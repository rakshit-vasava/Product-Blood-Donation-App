# Blood Factory - Blood Donation App Prototype

## ðŸš€ Project Overview
This project represents a prototype for an app called **Blood Factory**, aimed at bridging the gap between **blood donors** and **blood banks** in India. The app helps ensure that blood banks in critical need of blood supplies can connect with willing donors, creating a more efficient system to meet the urgent blood needs of patients.

**This project is a personal initiative** to enhance my **product management skills** by identifying a real-world problem, conceptualizing a solution, and designing the user experience. Through this process, I have worked on improving my skills in **feature prioritization**, **user research**, **prototyping**, and **problem-solving**, with the goal of delivering an app that provides real value to its users and simplifies the blood donation process.

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement
In India, many blood banks face shortages during emergencies, and patients' families are often tasked with arranging blood on their own. This can be a time-consuming and stressful process. The **Blood Factory** app offers a solution by connecting donors with blood banks that are in critical need of specific blood types, making the process easier and faster for everyone involved.

## ðŸŒŸ Goals
- **Improve product management skills** by creating a user-centered design for blood donation.
- Develop a prototype that simplifies the blood donation process by connecting donors and blood banks efficiently.
- **Enhance user experience** through thoughtful design and feature organization.

## ðŸ“± App Features
The prototype comprises **5 pages**, each addressing a critical part of the user journey for blood donors. This allowed me to practice how to structure product features based on user needs and streamline the user experience.

### 1. **Main Page**
- This is the **home page** of the app. It includes the **app name** and options for **login** or **sign-up** for new users.

### 2. **Donor Landing Page**
- This page is designed for donors to search for patients in need of blood. Donors can:
  - Search for patient info or by **location**.
  - Select their **blood group** and view a list of patients who need that specific blood type.
  - See the **number of blood bags** required and how much has been donated.
  - View **blood bank details** and navigate using the taskbar at the bottom for **home**, **notifications**, **filters**, and **profile**.

### 3. **Patient and Blood Bank Info**
- Once a donor selects a patient, they are redirected to this page.
  - View the **patient's details**, diagnosis, and **blood bank information**.
  - See how many bags of blood are still needed.
  - If the donor wishes to donate, they can click **Book Time**.

## ðŸ§  Vision
The **Blood Factory** app prototype is part of my journey to improve my product management skills. The goal is to address a real-world problem by brainstorming and designing a solution that improves the blood donation process in India. This prototype focuses on:
- **Making the donation process simple** for donors.
- Ensuring blood banks can maintain a **steady supply** of blood for patients in need.
- Reducing the stress on patients' families by eliminating the need to arrange for blood during critical times.

## ðŸ“ˆ Skills Enhanced
Through this project, I have focused on enhancing the following **product management skills**:
- **User research**: Identifying key pain points for both donors and blood banks.
- **Problem-solving**: Developing features that directly address the issue of blood shortages and donor-bank connectivity.
- **Feature prioritization**: Focusing on essential features that add immediate value to the users.
- **Prototyping**: Creating detailed wireframes to visualize the appâ€™s flow and structure.
- **UX Design**: Streamlining the user journey for ease of use and clarity.
- **Product strategy**: Addressing a real-world problem and positioning the app as a solution to blood bank shortages.
